-- [Lab] - Hunting Commands

-- This lab is a hunt for a variety of shell commands. To solve these, use the developer's most powerful tool: Google.

-- Write down all commands you've found. You may be asked to share your solutions during the lab. Try out all the commands you find!

--     Find a command to list the commands that you have used recently.
--     Find a command to delete a file. Try it on a file that you've created with touch.
--     Find out how to delete a directory with the command you found in 2.
--     Find a command to search for files and/or directories by their names.
--     Find a command to list all active running programs (i.e. processes) like your OS' Activity Monitor.
--     Find a command to download files from the Internet
--     Find a command to logout of the shell session
--     Find a command to exit the shell

-- Stretch:

--     Find a command to print environment variables
--     Find a command to create aliases




1.  Find a command to list the commands that you have used recently.
    $ history
    or
    $ history n

2.  Find a command to delete a file. Try it on a file that you've created with touch.
    $ rm FILE_NAME.txt

3.  Find out how to delete a directory with the command you found in 2.
    $ rmdir [DIR_NAME]
    or
    $ rmdir -r [DIR_NAME]

4.  Find a command to search for files and/or directories by their names.
    $ sudo find / -name [DIR_NAME] -type d

5.  Find a command to list all active running programs (i.e. processes) like your OS' Activity Monitor.
    $ ps aux
    or
    $ top
    or
    $ htop

6.  Find a command to download files from the Internet
    $ curl https://WEBSITE_TO_DOWNLOAD_FROM.com/FILE_NAME.txt -o /PATH/TO/DOWNLOAD/TO/FILE_NAME.txt
      - curl supports uploading data, and more protocols than FTP and HTTP.
    or
    $ wget https://WEBSITE_TO_DOWNLOAD_FROM.com/FILE_NAME.txt -O /PATH/TO/DOWNLOAD/TO/FILE_NAME.txt
      - -O /PATH/T.... is added if you want it to be downloaded to a specific file.
      - wget is more straight forward and can download recursively.

7.  Find a command to logout of the shell session
    $ logout
8.  Find a command to exit the shell
    $ exit

Stretch:

1.  Find a command to print environment variables
    $ printenv

2.  Find a command to create aliases
    $ alias name_for_new_shortcut="script you want shortcut for"
      - i.e. $ alias c="cd .."
