              <h3>How do I Make a regular Table Booking?</h3>
                  <p>It's a piece of cake - simply select your Date and Time required, and then so long as we have an email address and phone number your booking is instantly confirmed the minute you hit "Book".</p><br>
              <h3>How can I be certain my booking's been received?</h3>
                  <p>We'll send an instant confirmation email to the address used in your booking. If you book more than a day ahead, we'll also send a reminder 24 hours before your booking is due. You can reconfirm your booking using a link in your reminder email.</p><br>
              <h3>What happens if I'm running late?</h3>
                  <p>Call the restaurant. Every restaurant is different, but most will hold a booking for at least twenty minutes before reassigning your table. </p><br>
              <h3>What happens if I get to the restaurant and they don't have my booking?</h3>
                  <p>Restaurant Hub restaurants are committed to honour any confirmed bookings we have generated. For added peace of mind you should always reconfirm your booking using the the link included in your reminder email, and it's also a good idea to take your confirmation email with you. </p><br>
              <h3>How do I cancel a booking?</h3>
                  <p>To help our restaurants manage their sittings we ask our diners to give at least 24 hours' notice of any cancellations. You can do this by calling your restaurant direct.
                      If you need to cancel less than 24 hours before your dinner date you can use the cancellation link within your reminder email (sent 24 hours before your reservation time). We also encourage our diners to follow this up with a call direct to the restaurant.
                      To amend a booking please call the restaurant direct, again endeavouring to give at least 24 hours' notice.</p><br>
              <h3>Why do you need my email address?</h3>
                      <p>All Restaurant Hub bookings are automatically confirmed via email. Without an address to send the confirmation to the booking can't be accepted. We'll also use your email address to send reminders for any bookings made more than 24 hours in advance of your dining date.</p><br>
              <h3>How much do I have to pay for my booking?</h3>
                      <p>Absolutely nothing! All bookings made through Restaurant Hub are free to the consumer.</p><br>
              <h3>What happens if I get to the restaurant and they won't honour my deal?</h3>
                      <p>Restaurant Hub restaurants are committed to honour promotions sold as part of any Restaurant Hub booking. It's a good idea to always show the mobile phone email of your Coupon or Booking confirmation with you, just in case there is an issue.</p><br>
