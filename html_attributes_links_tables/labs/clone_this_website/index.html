          The goal of this assignment is to replicate this page, to the best of your ability, without having seen the HTML code.
        </div>
        <div>
          The exercise will help you understand how to break a webpage into sections in your mind before creating the code, which will allow you to code much more efficiently.
        </div>
        <ul><u>Take note to replicate things like:</u>
          <li>size of headers in relation to other headers</li>
          <li>the target value oflinks (they will state whether they open in a new tab or not)</li>
          <li>ul vs ol vs dl list options, with list-type specifications</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>You willbe recreating this entire page, however, in place of the assignment details, use lorem ipsum as a space filler</strong></p>
        <h2>This <a href="" target="_blank">Link</a> will open Google in a new tab</h2>
        <h3>This <a href="ibsom.html">Link</a> will open a second HTML document, in the same browser tab, and the second page will contain 100 words of lorem ipsum, and a linkthat will return back to the main HTML document</h3>
        <h4>This <a href="sushi.html" target="_black">Link</a> will open a third HTML document, in a new browser tab, containingan image of your choice, with a description of the photo below, as well as a link back to the main page.</h4>
